# Some research on MR Images and brain tumors.

### Basic Dataset
The Basic 3D dataset was build from combining two different datasets:
* One with just sick patients: [Kaggle - Brain MRI segmentation](https://www.kaggle.com/mateuszbuda/lgg-mri-segmentation).
* Another with just healthy patients: [IXI Dataset](http://brain-development.org/ixi-dataset/).

The images were analyzed and normalized to the same three-dimensional shape.
